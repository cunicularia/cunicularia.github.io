		<p> Hi! I am a prospective Master’s student on his way to studying biodiversity conservation. Having loved birds (especially owls) ever since I was a child, I initially wished to examine avian behaviour. However, after volunteering at the Stanley Park Ecology Society (the stewards of a popular local park), I was inspired to undertake a career in conservation. Now, I aim to study the effects of urbanization and other human disturbances on animal behaviour and ecology.</p>
		<p> If you’re interested in talking with me about conservation, birds, or anything else, you can definitely <a href="mailto:paulvchiu@gmail.com?Subject=Hello!" target="_top">shoot me an email</a> or <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/paul-chiu-94ba36a1/">connect with me on LinkedIn</a>.

      					<h4>Honours Thesis: An Analysis of Avian Population Trends in Metro Vancouver’s Stanley Park <a href="/documents/Paul%20Chiu%20%20Honours%20Thesis.pdf">(download pdf)</a></h4>
      					<p>
						<span class="bullet">Thanks to its location along the migration-heavy, highly-trafficked Pacific Flyway, Stanley Park is able to remain a biodiverse haven for bird watchers even with its proximity to the urbanized downtown region of Vancouver.</span>
						<span class="bullet">To better protect such a biodiverse population (of both flora and fauna), Stanley Park Ecology Society (SPES) has established a variety of monitoring programs. Past results has suggested that avian species that are more habituated to disturbances (e.g. off-trail biking, recreational watercrafts) may increase in abundance, while the less-habituated would become less prevalent.</span>
						<span class="bullet">To examine this, I performed an analysis on the avian population of the Park using  data from four sites - Beaver Lake, Lost Lagoon, Devonian Park, and the Seawall - collected by SPES between 2001 and 2002 and between 2005 and 2016.</span>
						<span class="bullet">My results indicated that, during the examined period,  the general population of all sites had experienced temporal trends in abundance and richness but not diversity (quantified by the Simpson’s Index of Diversity), that disturbance-adapted birds did not always experience stability or increasing abundance (although their richnesses were mostly stable), and that the birds less adapted to disturbances did not always experience decreasing abundance. In fact, the birds that are less adapted were usually stable in abundance and richness.</span>
						<span class="bullet">However, these results may not represent the true avian population of the Park due to the methodology. Future surveys should include another study site based entirely inside a forested area and should also be conducted at a higher frequency and with a consistent methodology.</span>

      					<p>The Stanley Park Ecology Society (SPES) is the non-profit organization treated as the de facto stewards of the flora and fauna of Vancouver’s world-famous Stanley Park. Upon the completion of my Honours thesis for which I collaborated with SPES, I was invited back to volunteer with them. There, I was allowed to help out with surveys, compile and analyze data, and even write reports. Here a few highlights from my time there:</p>

      					<p>The Regional Animal Protection Society (RAPS) runs North America’s largest cat sanctuary as well as the animal shelter of my hometown - Richmond, Canada. Volunteering at the latter, I interacted with cats in order to entertain them while also maintaining their cages (e.g. refill water, clean rooms) and other general tasks at the shelter (e.g. snow-shovelling, cleaning). Doing so allowed me to develop more skills and familiarity with handling cats and animals in general.</p>

      					<p>The Orphaned Wildlife Rehabilitation Society (OWL) is a rehabilitation centre that takes in sick and injured birds of prey from the surrounding cities. They also organize programs that bring raptors (who are already acclimated to humans) to various schools and events in order to educate the public on these birds. It was at one of these school presentations where my love for owls (and eventually other birds) was stoked, subsequently leading to my volunteering at OWL. There, I helped feed the raptors and other general tasks (e.g. laundry). Additionally, I was able to learn more about them while also becoming more comfortable with actual wild animals.</p>
