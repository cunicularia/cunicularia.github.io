		<p> Hello, I’m Paul! While I’m currently pursuing a
			<span class="bolded">Master of Education</span> 
			graduate degree from the University of Ottawa, 
			my home field is in 
			<span class="bolded">biodiversity conservation</span> 
			, having received a 
			<span class="bolded">Master of Conservation Science</span> 
			degree from the University of Queensland and an 
			<span class="bolded">Honour’s Bachelor’s of Science specializing in Animal Biology</span> 
			from the University of British Columbia.
		</p>
		<p>
			While the early phases of my education were focused on 
			<span class="bolded">avian ecology</span> 
			, I’ve transferred my love for birds (especially owls) into a career in 
			<span class="bolded">biodiversity conservation</span>
			, with a big inspiration for this move being the time I spent (and am currently still spending) interning with a local conservation organization 
			— Stanley Park Ecology Society (SPES). 
			With SPES, I’m able to assist with the 
			<span class="bolded">management of the flora and fauna living in Vancouver’s Stanley Park</span>
			— one of Canada’s most-popular protected sites (and one I’m privileged to live close to). 
			You can check out some of the projects I’ve done for them below!
		</p>
		<p>
			With that being said, 
			my experiences with SPES made me realize that there’s more to conservation than just heading out to the field and conducting experiments (even if it is fun to do) 
			— us conservationists also need to 
			<span class="bolded">talk with and make connections to members of the public in order to promote our field and try to get everybody living a bit more sustainably.</span> 
		</p>
		<p>
			Accordingly, my academic focus has now shifted to 
			<span class="bolded">conservation science education and communication</span>
			, with my Master’s project at the University of Queensland focused on 
			<span class="bolded">interpretive signage as a medium for promoting sustainable behaviours</span>
			and my current Master’s project at the University of Ottawa investigating the 
			<span class="bolded">reflections of undergraduate science students who had participated in an in-class activity during which they debated one another on science-related issues</span>
			, with the kicker being that they had no idea which side they were going to be arguing for until right before the debate started. 
		</p>
		<p>Anyways, if you’re interested in talking with me about science communication, conservation, birds, or anything else, 
			you can definitely <a href="mailto:paulvchiu@gmail.com?Subject=Hello!" target="_top">shoot me an email</a> 
			or <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/paul-chiu-94ba36a1/">connect with me on LinkedIn</a>.

							<div class="modal-body">
							  <p>An important role of environmental education is to encourage people to adopt Environmentally Responsible Behaviours (ERB). Research has progressed greatly since early behavioural models that inaccurately suggested that the simple provision of environmental knowledge would lead to ERB adoption. However, such updated research may be inaccessible to environmental educators. In response, this project reviewed recent literature (published 2006 and after) and sourced from them recommended practices applicable to promoting ERBs with interpretive signage — a popular communication method that educators use in various settings. From 60 publications — chosen as they relate to Australian nature-related sites — we identified 114 recommended practices organized into eight dimensions based off pre-existing frameworks (e.g. Community-based Social Marketing). We highlighted dimensions that should be prioritized for inclusion in future compilations of interpretive signage design guidelines because they may not be commonly known to environmental educators. These dimensions included <i>Call to Action</i>, <i>Perceived Behavioural Control</i>, <i>Attitudes/Beliefs</i>, <i>Message Framing</i>, and <i>Message Propagation</i> as their associated practices were under-used in the signage of nature sites that we surveyed and/or were specific to promoting ERBs. By informing the development/updating of future signage design guidelines, we hope to advance educators’ knowledge and support efforts to effect ERB uptake in their audience.</p>

							  <p>Stanley Park is a haven for birdwatchers. As many as 236 species have appeared in the park over the years even with its proximity to an urbanized area thanks to its location along the heavily-trafficked Pacific Flyway. With the biodiversity prevalent in the park as well as its importance for local tourism, the Stanley Park Ecology Society (SPES) monitors the population of flora and fauna in Stanley Park and uses this data to guide their efforts in maintaining the park’s biodiversity. Past research has indicated that avian species that are more habituated to disturbances may be able to increase in abundance. I performed a comprehensive analysis on the avian populations of Stanley Park using data collected from four sites (Beaver Lake, Lost Lagoon, Devonian Park, and the Seawall) by the SPES. My results indicated that the general avian populations at all four sites were experiencing temporal trends in abundance and richness but not diversity (quantified by the Simpson’s Index of Diversity), that disturbance-adapted birds did not always experience stability or increasing abundance (although their richnesses were mostly stable), and that the birds less adapted to disturbances did not always experience decreasing abundance. In fact, the birds that are less adapted were usually stable in abundance and also richness. However, these results may not represent the true avian population of Stanley Park due to the methodology. Future surveys should include another study site based entirely inside a forested area and should also be conducted at a higher frequency. Future analyses should also be objective as I determined temporal trends mostly by eye.</p>
