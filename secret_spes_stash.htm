				<p>For my Honours project in 2016, Maria let me play around with the monthly bird survey data and analyze temporal trends, but there were still a few gaps in the data. Later, in 2017, most of these gaps were filled in with the other monthly bird survey data compilation by Eckhardt Ferdinandi. In 2018, I updated the data compilation with most of the surveys performed in 2017.</p>
				<p>To examine the surveyed birds more extensively, each site's biodiversity was analyzed on four different tiers of exclusiveness, with the first tier being all birds as a whole and the final tier being individual species. For the 2018 Bird Update, I didn't examine the final tier at all as I wasn't sure if it was required, but I did end up leaving a tool in updated R code to help if that ever needs to be done.</p>
				<p>Note: Devonian Park and winter waterbird Seawall surveys were not updated for 2018 as I didn't receive any new data for them.</p>

		<h3>2018 R Code Update</h3>
		<div class="clearfix float-my-children">

				<div class="text">
				<p>To help out with quickly analyzing trends for my Honours project, I started using R because everybody was using it and I wanted to be cool. All my code was really ugly though, so with the 2018 Bird Update I decided to also update my R code.</p>
				<p>It's still ugly though, but it's way cleaner.</p>
				<p>Originally, I only had three functions: one for graphing overall site abundance, another for graphing individual species abundance, and a cross-checking version that I could use to compare trends. With the update, there are now five different functions:</p>
				<p class="bullet">info2(): provides quick little summaries about the site as a whole, a specific group at a site, or individual species at a site to help out a bit.</p>
				<p class="squarebullet">All Birds:  Finds the total richness and unique species of the sites. Also displays a detailed list of all species found by the monthly bird surveys.</p>
				<p class="squarebullet">Specific Groups: Grabs a list of all members of the searched group at the site. </p>
				<p class="squarebullet">Individual Species: Gives a quick run-down of the searched species; lists out the alpha code; English/common name; order; family; Tier 2 and Tier 3 listings, and disturbance-habituated, cavity nester, and at-risk status. Also tells you which site(s) it has been seen in as well as its row number in the info_box CSV and its column number in the records CSV.</p>
				<p class="bullet">graph3(): Graphs the abundance over time for all birds, specific groups, and individual species. Has a cross-checking feature if you want to compare different sites and/or different birds.</p>
				<p class="bullet">seasons2(): It's graph3() but the graph is organized to be seasonal instead. There's also no cross-checking. It might have been more efficient to just add it on to graph3(), but I was a bit worried about breaking it and also adding too much to it to the point of it being too confusing.</p>
				<p class="bullet">richness(): Graphs the richness over time for all birds, specific groups, and individual species.</p>
				<p class="bullet">fast(site,plot_type): A fast variation of graph3(). Takes in two parameters: site -- in the form of ("LL", "Lost Lagoon", or "lostlagoon" and any variation of them) -- and plot type -- in the form of "p" for points only, "l" for line only, and "o" for points and line.</p>
				<p class="squarebullet">In order to meet deadlines and figure out individual species trends as efficiently as possible, I used the original version to quickly rush through each species by using the species number (i.e. the number that they're ordered in). This version has the same function, but it's much cleaner.</p>
				<p class="squarebullet">To use the function, just include in the parameters (e.g. fast("ll","p")) and put in the species number that you want. Once the graph's finished and you've figured out the trend, use the shortcut that re-runs the function, put in another species number, and repeat.</p>

				<p>After completing my Honours project in 2016, I was asked back by Maria to also help author the bird-related sections of the SOPEI during Summer 2017. Seeing as that was basically a year ago, if you need me to edit anything (since I probably have a different perspective now) let me know.</p>
				<p>In short, I described ecological (i.e. abundance, richness, and biodiversity) trends happening with several key species, taxa, and groupings that Maria and the other Vanessa were interested in learning about and using as indicators for the ecological health of Stanley Park. This made it a much better and refined version of my thesis, basically greatly building up on it.</p>

				<div class="text">
				<p>Vanessa wanted to see if there could be any relationship between the Park's biodiversity and common air quality health indicators, so I grabbed publicly available data collected by the provincial government in downtown Vancouver/Robson Square/the Burrard Inlet and graphed out their changes since 2011. Both the chemical indicators and a calculated AQHI are graphed.</p>
				<p>Fun fact: One of the graphed chemical indicators was SO2. You can see SO2 levels dropping, coinciding with <a href="http://www.vancouversun.com/international+dramatically+reduces+sulphur+dioxide+emissions+metro+vancouver/10800239/story.html" target="_blank">a ban of SO2 in shipper fuel.</a></p>
				<p>I also wrote a function in R called yukon(). It's a quick little function that I threw together, based off of what the Yukon provincial government people were using as an indicator -- how many days was the recorded AQHI above a certain threshold. I didn't know what threshold Vanessa wanted, so yukon() is a quick-fire way to chart the temporal trends of the number of days where the AQHI is above the threshold you're after.</p>
