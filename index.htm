		<p> Hi! I am a <span class = "bolded">Masters of Conservation Science student</span> at the University of Queensland.

Now, I want to give back to the community by working in <span class = "bolded">conservation education</span> and/or in a <span class = "bolded">citizen science</span> position. While I already have handy <span class = "bolded">data analysis</span> (including knowledge of <span class = "bolded">R</span>) and <span class = "bolded">communication skills</span>, I am <span class = "bolded">always interested in improving</span> my abilities to develop my career even further.</p>

								Stanley Park is a haven for birdwatchers. As many as 236 species have appeared in the park over the years even with its proximity to an urbanized area thanks to its location along the heavily-trafficked Pacific Flyway. With the biodiversity prevalent in the park as well as its importance for local tourism, the Stanley Park Ecology Society (SPES) monitors the population of flora and fauna in Stanley Park and uses this data to guide their efforts in maintaining the park’s biodiversity. Past research has indicated that avian species that are more habituated to disturbances may be able to increase in abundance. I performed a comprehensive analysis on the avian populations of Stanley Park using data collected from four sites (Beaver Lake, Lost Lagoon, Devonian Park, and the Seawall) by the SPES. My results indicated that the general avian populations at all four sites were experiencing temporal trends in abundance and richness but not diversity (quantified by the Simpson’s Index of Diversity), that disturbance-adapted birds did not always experience stability or increasing abundance (although their richnesses were mostly stable), and that the birds less adapted to disturbances did not always experience decreasing abundance. In fact, the birds that are less adapted were usually stable in abundance and also richness. However, these results may not represent the true avian population of Stanley Park due to the methodology. Future surveys should include another study site based entirely inside a forested area and should also be conducted at a higher frequency. Future analyses should also be objective as I determined temporal trends mostly by eye.
